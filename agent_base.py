Base class to be subclassed to create an agent for playing
"K-in-a-Row with Forbidden Squares" and related games.

Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering,
University of Washington

THIS IS A TEMPLATE WITH STUBS FOR THE REQUIRED FUNCTIONS.

IMPORT IT INTO YOUR OWN AGENT MODULE AND SUBCLASS KAgent.
OVERRIDE METHODS AS NEEDED TO CREATE YOUR OWN AGENT.

YOU CAN PUT INTO YOUR MODULE WHATEVER ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONS 
YOU NEED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE YOUR AGENT IMPLEMENTATION.
